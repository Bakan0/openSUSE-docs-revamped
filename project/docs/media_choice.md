## Choosing an installation media
The installers and images can be obtained on the [Tumbleweed](https://software.opensuse.org/distributions/tumbleweed) and [Leap](https://software.opensuse.org/distributions/leap) pages.

Most users are used to Live images, packing a full-blown environment where they can test 
out a Linux distribution before installing.

!!! note for Tumbleweed
    Users interested in Tumbleweed should bear in mind that, because of the way Tumbleweed is built, Tumbleweed Live images are missing a handful of tests in comparison to Tumbleweed DVD images (see below). So even if Live images can be considered reasonably safe for most users, we cannot guarantee the same quality assurance as for DVD images.
    
Our live images (~950 MBs) provide the following desktop environments:

- KDE
- GNOME
- XFCE

They each come in different flavours tailor-suited to your CPU architecture:

- x86_64 (64-bit)
- i686 (32-bit)
- aarch64 (Armv8-A "ARM" 64-bit)

The two other installation media we provide are DVD images and Network installer.

- DVD images are quite bulky (~4.5 GBs), but allow you to install an entire distribution without relying on network for retrieving components.
- Networks installers are much lighter (~150 MBs); they require a stable and hopefully fast connection to fetch components over the network.
