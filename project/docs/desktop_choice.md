## Desktop Environments
Leap offers the __GNOME__ and __KDE Plasma__ desktop environments by default. Tumbleweed offers __GNOME__, __KDE Plasma__, and __XFCE__. These options are chosen during the __System Role__ selection of the installation. Additional options are available in the __Software__ selection of the installer. These desktop environment patterns may also be viewed and modified with the [YaST](/yast/) __Software Management__ module.

Modern desktop environments have evolved into highly consistent and productive computing experiences. Choosing the right desktop environment for you can be a deeply personal experience; many people feel as passionately about their desktop environment as they do their distribution. 

One of the distinguishing options of openSUSE, during the installation, is the ability to choose a desktop environment. This provides a certain level of assurance that you will have a well-supported desktop experience for that respective desktop environment, no derivatives or spin-offs needed.

### Installation

During __openSUSE Installation__, there is a section titled __System Role__, which applies patterns to the software selected for the respective installation. This is the primary means to select a desktop environment. There is an additional option titled __Generic Desktop__. If you wish to install a desktop environment available in the installer, but not in a Role, you can select __Generic Desktop__ and customize the Software selection later within the installer.

The descriptions below are as provided by the respective projects.
### GNOME
> GNOME 3 has been designed from the ground up to help you have the best     possible computing experience.
>
> GNOME 3 provides a focused working environment that helps you to get things done, and it is packed with features that will make you more productive. A powerful search feature lets you access all your work from one place. Side-by-side windows makes it easy to view several documents at the same time, and we even provide a way to turn off notifications when you really need to concentrate on the task in hand.

    __Installer__ &gt; __System Role__: Select __Desktop with GNOME__
### KDE Plasma
> Plasma is made to stay out of the way as it helps you get things done. But under its light and intuitive surface, it's a powerhouse. So you're free to choose ways of usage right as you need them and when you need them.
>
> With Plasma the user is king. Not happy with the color scheme? Change it! Want to have your panel on the left edge of the screen? Move it! Don't like the font? Use a different one! Download custom widgets in one click and add them to your desktop or panel.

### XFCE
> Xfce is a lightweight desktop environment for UNIX-like operating systems. It aims to be fast and low on system resources, while still being visually appealing and user friendly.
>
> Xfce embodies the traditional UNIX philosophy of modularity and re-usability. It consists of a number of components that provide the full functionality one can expect of a modern desktop environment. They are packaged separately and you can pick among the available packages to create the optimal personal working environment.
>
> Another priority of Xfce is adherence to standards, specifically those defined at freedesktop.org.

Windows can be iconified to the taskbar, to the tray, to the desktop or be made hidden. They are controllable by a quick switch window (Alt+Tab) and in a window list.

Unlike other tightly integrated desktops LXDE strives to be modular, so each component can be used independently with few dependencies. This makes porting LXDE to different distributions and platforms easier.
