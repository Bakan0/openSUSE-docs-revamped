## Live demo
Our latest build is live at https://opensuse.github.io/openSUSE-docs-revamped/.

## /!\ Disclaimer
This is the construction site for the upcoming Leap and Tumbleweed documentation. Please do not consider any of this as official documentation. Use instead:
- Generic documentation based on Leap: https://doc.opensuse.org/
- Tumbleweed specific knowledge-base: https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:Tumbleweed

## About
Take a look at the "About" section (right panel). You can also check [this](https://news.opensuse.org/2020/10/12/join-our-team-and-help-us-imporove-the-openSUSE-learning-experience/) out for context. If you wonder why we are doing this when there is already an official documentation along with wikis, the answer is two-fold a nutshell:
* wikis make it difficult to sort the outdated / unofficial stuff from the up-to-date / official stuff
* the official docs is slightly outdated, provides too little recommendations or best-practice advices on top of technical facts, is tedious to navigate at times and does not cater for Tumbleweed users.

## Contributing
1. Check out on the table of contents below.
2. Refer to the instructions available [here](https://github.com/openSUSE/openSUSE-docs-revamped/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTING.md).

We are working with people from the official docs to move to a maintainer-centric model, which we believe will better serve the openSUSE community.
