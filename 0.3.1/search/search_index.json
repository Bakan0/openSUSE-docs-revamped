Tumbleweed offers GNOME , KDE Plasma , and XFCE . These options are chosen during the System Role selection of the installation. Additional options are available in the Software selection of the installer. These desktop environment patterns may also be viewed and modified with the YaST Software Management module. Modern desktop environments have evolved into highly consistent and productive computing experiences. Choosing the right desktop environment for you can be a deeply personal experience; many people feel as passionately about their desktop environment as they do their distribution. One of the distinguishing options of openSUSE, during the installation, is the ability to choose a desktop environment. This provides a certain level of assurance that you will have a well-supported desktop experience for that respective desktop environment, no derivatives or spin-offs needed. Installation \u2693\ufe0e During openSUSE Installation , there is a section titled System Role , which applies patterns to the software selected for the respective installation. This is the primary means to select a desktop environment. There is an additional option titled Generic Desktop . If you wish to install a desktop environment available in the installer, but not in a Role, you can select Generic Desktop and customize the Software selection later within the installer. The descriptions below are as provided by the respective projects. GNOME \u2693\ufe0e GNOME 3 has been designed from the ground up to help you have the best possible computing experience. GNOME 3 provides a focused working environment that helps you to get things done, and it is packed with features that will make you more productive. A powerful search feature lets you access all your work from one place. Side-by-side windows makes it easy to view several documents at the same time, and we even provide a way to turn off notifications when you really need to concentrate on the task in hand. GNOME.org Install Gnome Installer > System Role : Select Desktop with GNOME KDE Plasma \u2693\ufe0e Plasma is made to stay out of the way as it helps you get things done. But under its light and intuitive surface, it's a powerhouse. So you're free to choose ways of usage right as you need them and when you need them. With Plasma the user is king. Not happy with the color scheme? Change it! Want to have your panel on the left edge of the screen? Move it! Don't like the font? Use a different one! Download custom widgets in one click and add them to your desktop or panel. KDE.org Install KDE Plasma Installer > System Role : Select Desktop with KDE Plasma XFCE \u2693\ufe0e Xfce is a lightweight desktop environment for UNIX-like operating systems. It aims to be fast and low on system resources, while still being visually appealing and user friendly. Xfce embodies the traditional UNIX philosophy of modularity and re-usability. It consists of a number of components that provide the full functionality one can expect of a modern desktop environment. They are packaged separately and you can pick among the available packages to create the optimal personal working environment. Another priority of Xfce is adherence to standards, specifically those defined at freedesktop.org.

Generic Desktop \u2693\ufe0e Another option for a System Role is the Generic Desktop environment. This option enables IceWM , but also allows selection of one of the optional desktop environments later, during the Software selection of the installation. If you intend to choose one of the other desktop environments, choose Yes , when asked \"Activate online repositories now?\" and ensure Main Repository (OSS) is enabled on the Online Repositories step. IceWM \u2693\ufe0e IceWM is a window manager for the X Window System. The goal of IceWM is speed, simplicity, and not getting in the user\u2019s way. It comes with a taskbar with pager, global and per-window keybindings and a dynamic menu system. Application windows can be managed by keyboard and mouse. Windows can be iconified to the taskbar, to the tray, to the desktop or be made hidden. They are controllable by a quick switch window (Alt+Tab) and in a window list. Ice-WM.org Install IceWM Installer > System Role : Select Generic Desktop Additional Choices \u2693\ufe0e Before confirming the installation, an overview is provided with the selected installation options, title Installer Settings . At this point, you can modify the Software selected to be installed. In addition to reducing or adding packages, you can also select other desktop environments to install. If you prefer one of these desktop environments, de-select the A very basic desktop pattern, then select one of the below patterns: Enlightenment \u2693\ufe0e Enlightenment is classed as a \"desktop shell\" as it provides everything you need to operate your desktop or laptop, but it is not a full application suite.

Most users are used to Live images, packing a full-blown environment where they can test out a Linux distribution before installing. Note Users interested in Tumbleweed should bear in mind that, because of the way Tumbleweed is built, Tumbleweed Live images are missing a handful of tests in comparison to Tumbleweed DVD images (see below). So even if Live images can be considered reasonably safe for most users, we cannot guarantee the same quality assurance as for DVD images. Our live images (~950 MBs) provide the following desktop environments: KDE GNOME XFCE They each come in different flavours tailor-suited to your CPU architecture: x86_64 (64-bit) i686 (32-bit) aarch64 (Armv8-A \"ARM\" 64-bit) The two other installation media we provide are DVD images and Network installer. DVD images are quite bulky (~4.5 GBs), but allow you to install an entire distribution without relying on network for retrieving components. Networks installers are much lighter (~150 MBs); they require a stable and hopefully fast connection to fetch components over the network. Authenticity & integrity checks \u2693\ufe0e Note The following two steps are optional, but are considered good practice. You perform an integrity check when you want to make sure that a given file has not been tampered with. It typically involves making sure that a file's checksum matches a certain target. You perform an authenticity check when you want to make sure that a file -- typically the file that specifies the checksum target -- was obtained from a legitimate source (i.e. openSUSE). Because performing an integrity check against an inauthentic target does not make sense, you want to first do an authenticity check, and only then do an integrity check. Assumptions & definitions \u2693\ufe0e In what follows we make the following assumptions: You have downloaded an openSUSE Live, Network or DVD image from openSUSE website (hereafter: the Image ): Tumbleweed Leap You have obtained the Target Checksum file for your image, by clicking on the Checksum next to the image. You have obtained openSUSE gpg Public Key by importing it via its keyid into your gpg keyring with $ gpg --recv-keys 0x22C07BA534178CD02EFE22AAB88B2FD43DBDC284 You have obtained an openSUSE gpg Detached Signature file corresponding to the image you want to perform the check upon. The Tumbleweed detached signature files are held within a single directory here . Regarding Leap however you need to start there and use the /live subdirectory for the live images and the rescue images, and the /iso subdirectory for net installers and DVD images. Once you have the signature file, the command looks like this (i.e. for KDE Live): $ wget http://download.opensuse.org/tumbleweed/iso/openSUSE-Tumbleweed-KDE-Live-x86_64-Current.iso.sha256.asc Authenticity check \u2693\ufe0e It is an instance of the command: $ gpg --verify <Detached Signature.asc> <Target Checksum.iso.sha256> The check passes just in case the above command outputs calls it a success. Warning If the check fails, make sure you are honouring our assumptions . Integrity check \u2693\ufe0e It is an instance of the command: $ sha256sum <Image.iso> The check passes just in case the output of the above equals the checksum written in plain text in the Target Checksum (see Definitions & assumptions ).","title":"Preparing the installation media"},{"location":"media_choice/#choosing-an-installation-media","text":"The installers and images can be obtained on the Tumbleweed and Leap pages.

Installation: GNOME \u2693\ufe0e Make sure you install a browser and unzip via transactional-updates if you want to use Gnome extensions. Then some commands are in order: Install some useful packages trough transactional-update and then reboot: $ sudo transactional-update pkg install gnome-remote-desktop gnome-shell-search-provider-nautilus chromium gnome-tweaks unzip $ sudo reboot Some necessary commands for Gnome Software: $ gsettings set org.gnome.software install-bundles-system-wide false $ gsettings set org.gnome.software allow-updates false $ gsettings set org.gnome.software download-updates false $ gsettings set org.gnome.software enable-repos-dialog false $ gsettings set org.gnome.software first-run true and the following: $ sudo rm -Rf /var/cache/app-info $ sudo transactional-update shell # rpm -e --nodeps libzypp-plugin-appdata # zypper al libzypp-plugin-appdata # exit $ sudo reboot Installation: KDE \u2693\ufe0e In Discover , enable the flatpak repository. For theming, normal theme installations don\u2019t work in KDE. But you can install themes via a transactional-update shell: (For example the Arc theme and papirus-icon-theme) $ sudo transactional-update shell # cd /tmp # wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PapirusDevelopmentTeam/arc-kde/master/install.sh | sh # wget -qO- https://git.io/papirus-icon-theme-install | sh # exit $ sudo reboot Other themes: Qogir-icon-theme Matcha-gtk Matcha-KDE General tips \u2693\ufe0e I recommend disabling automatic updating and rebooting as well. It\u2019s a cool feature, and we\u2019re thinking about how to have it better integrated into a desktop distribution. For now, I\u2019ve disabled it and I recommend doing the same, at least until you have learned a little bit about it, are more familiar with the idea and with the basics of how it works, and come come-up with the best automatic updating & rebooting strategy for your workflow and use case. So: $ sudo systemctl disable --now transactional-update.timer $ sudo systemctl disable --now rebootmgr.service And then let\u2019s check: $ sudo rebootmgrctl is-active *RebootMgr is dead* $ sudo rebootmgrctl status *Error: The name org.opensuse.RebootMgr was not provided by any .service files* Updates are now to be initialised manually with: $ sudo transactional-update dup Or $ sudo transactional-update shell # zypper dup # exit I also recommend installing a few more packages that are useful. $ sudo transactional-update pkg install bash-completion wget nfs-client autofs $ sudo reboot Installing flatpaks \u2693\ufe0e The flatpak package is already installed, all that needs to be done is add the flathub repo. Within KDE this is possible from within Discover. For Gnome you have to use one of the two options below (also possible for KDE if you don't like Discover): If you want to install flathub for only your user (in /home/~ folder ): $ flatpak remote-add --user --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo If you want to install flathub for all users (in /var folder ): $ flatpak remote-add --if-not-exists flathub https://flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo Some flatpaks you could install: - Firefox - Libreoffice - VLC - etc. Installing snapds \u2693\ufe0e Snaps are mainly used within Ubuntu, however it is possible to install them as well in openSUSE MicroOS, the following commands will install it. $ sudo transactional-update shell # zypper addrepo --refresh https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/system:/snappy/openSUSE_Tumbleweed snappy # zypper --gpg-auto-import-keys refresh # zypper ref # zypper dup --from snappy # zypper in snapd # exit $ sudo reboot $ sudo mksubvolume /snap $ source /etc/profile $ sudo systemctl enable --now snapd $ sudo systemctl enable --now snapd.apparmor You can install snaps then via the terminal (for example the snap store where you can find snaps and install them via the GUI): $ sudo snap install snap-store Installing virtualbox \u2693\ufe0e $ sudo transactional-update shell # zypper ref # zypper in virtualbox-qt # exit $ sudo reboot Adding the extension pack for the host \u2693\ufe0e $ sudo transactional-update shell # cd /tmp # LatestVirtualBoxVersion=$(wget -qO - https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/LATEST-STABLE.TXT) && wget \"https://download.virtualbox.org/virtualbox/${LatestVirtualBoxVersion}/Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-${LatestVirtualBoxVersion}.vbox-extpack\" # VBoxManage extpack install --replace Oracle_VM_VirtualBox_Extension_Pack-${LatestVirtualBoxVersion}.vbox-extpack # exit $ sudo reboot Adding software from OBS \u2693\ufe0e Find what you are looking for on https://software.opensuse.org . Then choose the OpenSUSE Tumbleweed repo, but you can't use the 1-click install, as there is no YaST and the 1-click installer has no access to a transactional-update. So for example if we install zerotier , pick a TumbleWeed repository. But click on Expert Download And choose the Add repository and install manually option. $ sudo transactional-update shell # zypper addrepo https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/home:alphard:Network:RPM/openSUSE_Tumbleweed/home:alphard:Network:RPM.repo # zypper ref # zypper in zerotier-one # exit $ sudo reboot Tips if you're installing on laptop \u2693\ufe0e My laptop install was missing 2 important packages: tlp for better battery management ModemManager because my laptop has a WWAN moden You can install both with: $ sudo transactional-update pkg install tlp ModemManager $ sudo reboot Known Issues \u2693\ufe0e No graphical session/login screen in Hyper-V \u2693\ufe0e hyper-v needs package \"xf86-video-fbdev\" for graphical session sudo transactional-update pkg install xf86-video-fbdev Toolbox is not starting (\"potentially insufficient UIDs and GIDs\") \u2693\ufe0e uid/guid needs to be set for toolbox to work echo \"<yourusername>:100000:65536\" > /etc/subuid echo \"<yourusername>:100000:65536\" > /etc/subgid Graphical applications in the toolbox are missing fonts/icons \u2693\ufe0e They need to be installed inside the toolbox sudo zypper install xorg-x11-fonts-core adwaita-icon-theme","title":"microOS specials"},{"location":"microos_getting_started/#setting-up-microos-as-a-desktop-os","text":"","title":"Setting up MicroOS as a desktop OS"},{"location":"microos_getting_started/#pre-installation","text":"grab ISO from https://en.opensuse.org/Portal:MicroOS/Downloads put ISO on a USB drive and start the installation proces. choose if you want to use Gnome or KDE.","title":"Pre-installation"},{"location":"microos_getting_started/#installation-gnome","text":"Make sure you install a browser and unzip via transactional-updates if you want to use Gnome extensions.

Timeline snapshots are single snapshots, created every hour and old snapshots are automatically deleted. Disabled by default, the only single snapshots present may be the ones created when openSUSE was installed. Installation snapshots are created in pairs ( Pre and Post ) when packages are installed with YaST or Zypper.

It also manages repositories, can perform various queries, and is a command-line interface to ZYpp system management library (libzypp). Definitions \u2693\ufe0e Show Definitions repository Local or remote directory containing packages and various package information (package metadata). package Software package (RPM package, source package). Patches, patterns, and products are also commonly referred to as different types of packages. patch Represents a package or a group of packages needed to install an update (a bug fix mostly). pattern Represents a group of packages. For example an Http Server pattern would have the dependencies defined so that all packages needed to run and manage an http server would have been triggered for installation when upon installing the pattern. product Represents the whole product (e.g. 'openSUSE Leap 15.3'). Usage \u2693\ufe0e Info The components enclosed in brackets are not required, thus the simplest way to execute zypper is to type its name followed by a command. See zypper help for a list of general options and all commands. To get help for a specific command, type zypper help command # zypper [--GLOBAL-OPTIONS] <COMMAND> [--COMMAND-OPTIONS] [ARGUMENTS] # zypper <SUBCOMMAND> [--COMMAND-OPTIONS] [ARGUMENTS] Note Whenever Zypper needs input, it lists possible answers in brackets next to the prompt text. To choose the default answer, press < Enter > (the default answer is printed in capitals, with the exception of non-ascii characters). Some prompts also have help available, in which case there is a question mark '?' listed as a possible answer. Tip To make Zypper use the default answers without user interaction, use the --non-interactive global option. Commands \u2693\ufe0e Tip Zypper provides commands to be used in various manners, but it also provides abbreviated aliases of those commands. If there is an alias it will be listed next to the command. # zypper without any commands or arguments will print a list of commands and options.

Install packages with specified capabilities or RPM files with specified location. A capability is NAME[.ARCH][OP<VERSION>], where OP is one of <, <=, =, >=, >. Command options: -t, --type <TYPE> Type of package (package, patch, pattern, product). -n, --name Select packages by plain name, not by capability. Default: false -C, --capability Select packages solely by capability. Default: false --details Show the detailed installation summary. Default: false --from <ALIAS|#|URI> Select packages from the specified repository. --oldpackage Allow to replace a newer item with an older one. Handy if you are doing a rollback. Unlike --force it will not enforce a reinstall. Default: false --allow-unsigned-rpm Silently install unsigned rpm packages given as commandline parameters. Default: false -f, --force Install even if the item is already installed (reinstall), downgraded or changes vendor or architecture. Default: false -r, --repo <ALIAS|#|URI> Work only with the specified repository. -y, --no-confirm Don't require user interaction. Alias for the --non-interactive global option. Default: false -D, --dry-run Don't change anything, just report what would be done. A meaningful file conflict check can only be performed if used together with '--download-only'. Default: false --replacefiles Install the packages even if they replace files from other, already installed, packages. Default is to treat file conflicts as an error. --download-as-needed disables the fileconflict check. Default: false -l, --auto-agree-with-licenses Automatically say 'yes' to third party license confirmation prompt. See 'man zypper' for more details. Default: false --download <MODE> Set the download-install mode. Available modes: only, in-advance, in-heaps, as-needed Default: DownloadDefault -d, --download-only Only download the packages, do not install. Solver options --debug-solver Create a solver test case for debugging. --force-resolution Force the solver to find a solution (even an aggressive one) rather than asking. -R, --no-force-resolution Do not force the solver to find a solution, let it ask. --solver-focus <MODE> Set the solvers general attitude when resolving a job. --recommends Install also recommended packages in addition to the required ones. --no-recommends Do not install recommended packages, only required ones. Expert options --allow-downgrade --no-allow-downgrade Whether to allow downgrading installed resolvables. --allow-name-change --no-allow-name-change Whether to allow changing the names of installed resolvables. --allow-arch-change --no-allow-arch-change Whether to allow changing the architecture of installed resolvables. --allow-vendor-change --no-allow-vendor-change Whether to allow changing the vendor of installed resolvables.","title":"Zypper"},{"location":"zypper/#zypper","text":"Zypper is a command line package manager for installing, updating and removing packages.

Patches, patterns, and products are also commonly referred to as different types of packages. patch Represents a package or a group of packages needed to install an update (a bug fix mostly). pattern Represents a group of packages. For example an Http Server pattern would have the dependencies defined so that all packages needed to run and manage an http server would have been triggered for installation when upon installing the pattern. product Represents the whole product (e.g. 'openSUSE Leap 15.3').","title":"Definitions"},{"location":"zypper/#usage","text":"Info The components enclosed in brackets are not required, thus the simplest way to execute zypper is to type its name followed by a command.
