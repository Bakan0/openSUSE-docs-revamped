OS Orientation Here you will find several walk-though for the different features of Linux in general and openSUSE in paticular. You will become familiar with the user interface, system settings, installing and upgrading software and general good computing practices. You will also learn how the use the unique openSUSE features like YaST and snapshots. After Install Setup In this section you will find setup information for devices you might or might not have. This could be a printer, scanner or a dedicated grapic card. You will also find information on how to install software that you cannot find in the official openSUSE software repositories. Advanced Install If you are an experienced user you might want to setup your system in a particular way to take advantage of the latest Linux technologies. In this section you will find information on how to setup openSUSE with these technologies. Topics covered include advanced partitioning schemes, encryption, display servers, vulnerability mitigation, etc. Advanced Topics Now that you're familiar with Linux and openSUSE, you might want to get the most out of it. In this section you'll find information on how to take full advantage of the Linux and openSUSE tools like YaST, Zypper, Snapper, etc. Other Documentation In this section you will have reference documentation and guides suitable for corporate users and system administrators in various formats (HTML, PDF and EPUB)","title":"Welcome"},{"location":"#welcome","text":"Are you looking for sane Linux documentation?
